# This assignment is part of Module 2 - Introduction to Data Science in the Packham DAZ program.


For this project, I used data from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/paris-2024-olympics-medals. The task involved collecting data and representing it visually through a graph. I worked with Python 3.11.4 as the programming language. The data for the graph showed a distribution of 31.6% for gold medals, 31.5% for silver, and 37% for bronze. I chose to visualize this data using a pie chart, and the libraries I utilized were fsspec and matplotlib.
